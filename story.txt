BIRTH
Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem to Mary and Joseph, fulfilling a prophecy. Mary, a virgin, conceived through the Holy Spirit. They traveled to Bethlehem, where there was no room in the inn, so Jesus was born in a stable. Angels announced His birth to shepherds, who visited Him. Wise men, guided by a star, brought gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. His birth marked the beginning of the Christian faith, which was believed to bring salvation to the world.


BAPTISM
From the moment Jesus was born in a humble stable in Bethlehem, His life was filled with divine purpose. As He grew, His heart was set on fulfilling God's will. At age 30, He sought John the Baptist at the Jordan River. Though sinless, He humbly stepped into the waters, showing His solidarity with humanity. As He rose, the heavens parted, and the Holy Spirit descended like a dove, while God's voice echoed, "This is my Son, whom I love." It was a moment of divine affirmation, marking the beginning of His ministry.


CRUCIFIXION
The crucifixion was the darkest yet most significant moment in Jesus’ life. After being betrayed by Judas, arrested, and condemned, Jesus was sentenced to death by crucifixion. He carried His cross through the streets of Jerusalem, burdened by the weight of humanity’s sins. Nailed to the cross, He endured excruciating pain, yet forgave those who wronged Him. As He breathed His last, the sky darkened, and the temple veil tore. His death marked the ultimate sacrifice for mankind’s redemption, fulfilling God's promise of salvation.


ASCENSION
After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples over 40 days, teaching them and strengthening their faith. One day, He led them to the Mount of Olives near Jerusalem. There, He gave them final instructions, telling them to spread His message to all nations. As they watched in awe, Jesus was lifted up into the sky, a cloud taking Him from their sight. Two angels appeared, reassuring them that He would return in the same way. With that, His earthly presence ended, and He ascended to reign in Heaven.
